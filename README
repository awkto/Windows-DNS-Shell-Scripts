This script will start with a list of domains which must be placed in 'ad-domains.var' as a local file
This script must be run via WSL or Cygwin. This is because it relies on both Bash binaries, as well as Windows binaries (dnscmd).

This script will perform the following 3 loops
- Fetch list of DCs for each AD domain
- Fetch list of Conditional Forwarder zones for each AD domain (using a random DC)
- Fetch list of Conditional Forwarder Targets for each CF zone

Each of the above 3 steps aligns with a separate script in this repo. (loop1, loop2, loop3).
The number next to the loop name indicates the order in which the scripts must be run.

The scripts will also store their variables and outputs in local files that end with .mid
This can be used for troubleshooting. Otherwise those files can be discarded after you have finished using the scripts

The final output will have the file extension .out
